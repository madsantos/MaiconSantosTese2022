	abstract = {Cloud computing is emerging as a promising alternative to supercomputers for some high-performance computing (HPC) applications. With cloud as an additional deployment option, HPC users and providers are faced with the challenges of dealing with highly heterogeneous resources, where the variability spans across a wide range of processor conﬁgurations, interconnects, virtualization environments, and pricing models. In this paper, we take a holistic viewpoint to answer the question – why and who should choose cloud for HPC, for what applications, and how should cloud be used for HPC? To this end, we perform comprehensive performance and cost evaluation and analysis of running a set of HPC applications on a range of platforms, varying from supercomputers to clouds. Further, we improve performance of HPC applications in cloud by optimizing HPC applications’ characteristics for cloud and cloud virtualization mechanisms for HPC. Finally, we present novel heuristics for online application-aware job scheduling in multi-platform environments. Experimental results and simulations using CloudSim show that current clouds cannot substitute supercomputers but can effectively complement them. Signiﬁcant improvement in average turnaround time (up to 2X) and throughput (up to 6X) can be attained using our intelligent application-aware dynamic scheduling heuristics compared to single-platform or application-agnostic scheduling.},

	abstract = {While large grids are currently supporting the work of thousands of scientists, very little is known about their actual use. Due to strict organizational permissions, there are few or no traces of grid workloads available to the grid researcher and practitioner. To address this problem, in this work we present the Grid Workloads Archive (GWA), which is at the same time a workload data exchange and a meeting point for the grid community. We deﬁne the requirements for building a workload archive, and describe the approach taken to meet these requirements with the GWA. We introduce a format for sharing grid workload information, and tools associated with this format. Using these tools, we collect and analyze data from nine well-known grid environments, with a total content of more than 2000 users submitting more than 7 million jobs over a period of over 13 operational years, and with working environments spanning over 130 sites comprising 10 000 resources. We show evidence that grid workloads are very different from those encountered in other large-scale environments, and in particular from the workloads of parallel production environments: they comprise almost exclusively single-node jobs, and jobs arrive in “bags-of-tasks”. Finally, we present the immediate applications of the GWA and of its content in several critical grid research and practical areas: research in grid resource management, and grid design, operation, and maintenance.},

	abstract = {With the significant advances in Information and Communications Technology (ICT) over the last half century, there is an increasingly perceived vision that computing will one day be the 5th utility (after water, electricity, gas, and telephony). This computing utility, like all other four existing utilities, will provide the basic level of computing service that is considered essential to meet the everyday needs of the general community. To deliver this vision, a number of computing paradigms have been proposed, of which the latest one is known as Cloud computing. Hence, in this paper, we define Cloud computing and provide the architecture for creating Clouds with market-oriented resource allocation by leveraging technologies such as Virtual Machines (VMs). We also provide insights on market-based resource management strategies that encompass both customer-driven service management and computational risk management to sustain Service Level Agreement (SLA)-oriented resource allocation. In addition, we reveal our early thoughts on interconnecting Clouds for dynamically creating global Cloud exchanges and markets. Then, we present some representative Cloud platforms, especially those developed in industries, along with our current work towards realizing market-oriented resource allocation of Clouds as realized in Aneka enterprise Cloud technology. Furthermore, we highlight the difference between High Performance Computing (HPC) workload and Internet-based services workload. We also describe a metanegotiation infrastructure to establish global Cloud exchanges and markets, and illustrate a case study of harnessing ‘Storage Clouds’ for high performance content delivery. Finally, we conclude with the need for convergence of competing IT paradigms to deliver our 21st century vision.},

	abstract = {Bag-of-Tasks (BoT) workflows are widespread in many big data analysis fields. However, there are very few cloud resource provisioning and scheduling algorithms tailored for BoT workflows. Furthermore, existing algorithms fail to consider the stochastic task execution times of BoT workflows which leads to deadline violations and increased resource renting costs. In this paper, we propose a dynamic cloud resource provisioning and scheduling algorithm which aims to fulfill the workflow deadline by using the sum of task execution time expectation and standard deviation to estimate real task execution times. A bag-based delay scheduling strategy and a single-type based virtual machine interval renting method are presented to decrease the resource renting cost. The proposed algorithm is evaluated using a cloud simulator ElasticSim which is extended from CloudSim. The results show that the dynamic algorithm decreases the resource renting cost while guaranteeing the workflow deadline compared to the existing algorithms.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing manages a variety of virtualized resources, which makes scheduling a critical component. In the cloud, a client may utilize several thousand virtualized assets for every task. Consequently, manual scheduling is not a feasible solution. The basic idea behind task scheduling is to slate tasks to minimize time loss and maximize performance. Several research efforts have examined task scheduling in the past. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of task scheduling strategies and the associated metrics suitable for cloud computing environments. It discusses the various issues related to scheduling methodologies and the limitations to overcome. Distinctive scheduling procedures are studied to discover which characteristics are to be included in a given system and which ones to disregard. The literature survey is organized based on three different perspectives: methods, applications, and parameter-based measures utilized. In addition, future research issues related to cloud computing-based scheduling are identified.},

In this paper we introduce a classification of the scheduling problem in distributed systems by presenting a taxonomy that incorporates recent developments, especially those in cloud computing. We review the scheduling literature to corroborate the taxonomy and analyze the interest in different branches of the proposed taxonomy.

Now, it has emerged as the backbone of modern economy by offering subscription-based services anytime, anywhere following a pay-as-you-go model. This has instigated (1) shorter establishment times for start-ups, (2) creation of scalable global enterprise applications, (3) better cost-to-value associativity for scientific and high performance computing applications, and (4) different invocation/execution models for pervasive and ubiquitous applications. The recent technological developments and paradigms such as serverless computing, software-defined networking, Internet of Things, and processing at network edge are creating new opportunities for Cloud computing. However, they are also posing several new challenges and creating the need for new approaches and research strategies, as well as the re-evaluation of the models that were developed to address issues such as scalability, elasticity, reliability, security, sustainability, and application models. The proposed manifesto addresses them by identifying the major open challenges in Cloud computing, emerging trends, and impact areas.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05610},
	abstract = {Edge computing is promoted to meet increasing performance needs of data-driven services using computational and storage resources close to the end devices, at the edge of the current network. To achieve higher performance in this new paradigm one has to consider how to combine the efﬁciency of resource usage at all three layers of architecture: end devices, edge devices, and the cloud. While cloud capacity is elastically extendable, end devices and edge devices are to various degrees resource-constrained. Hence, an efﬁcient resource management is essential to make edge computing a reality. In this work, we ﬁrst present terminology and architectures to characterize current works within the ﬁeld of edge computing. Then, we review a wide range of recent articles and categorize relevant aspects in terms of 4 perspectives: resource type, resource management objective, resource location, and resource use. This taxonomy and the ensuing analysis is used to identify some gaps in the existing research. Among several research gaps, we found that research is less prevalent on data, storage, and energy as a resource, and less extensive towards the estimation, discovery and sharing objectives. As for resource types, the most well-studied resources are computation and communication resources. Our analysis shows that resource management at the edge requires a deeper understanding of how methods applied at different levels and geared towards different resource types interact. Speciﬁcally, the impact of mobility and collaboration schemes requiring incentives are expected to be different in edge architectures compared to the classic cloud solutions. Finally, we ﬁnd that fewer works are dedicated to the study of non-functional properties or to quantifying the footprint of resource management techniques, including edge-speciﬁc means of migrating data and services.},

	abstract = {Background— The proliferation of cloud providers and provisioning levels has opened a space for cloud brokerage services. Brokers intermediate between cloud customers and providers to assist the customer in selecting the most suitable cloud service, helping to manage the dimensionality, heterogeneity, and uncertainty associated with cloud services. Objective— This paper identiﬁes and classiﬁes approaches to realise cloud brokerage. By doing so, this paper presents an understanding of the state of the art and a novel taxonomy to characterise cloud brokers. Method— We conducted a systematic literature survey to compile studies related to cloud brokerage and explore how cloud brokers are engineered. We analysed the studies from multiple perspectives, such as motivation, functionality, engineering approach, and evaluation methodology. Results— The survey resulted in a knowledge base of current proposals for realising cloud brokers. The survey identiﬁed surprising differences between the studies’ implementations, with engineering efforts directed at combinations of market-based solutions, middlewares, toolkits, algorithms, semantic frameworks, and conceptual frameworks. Conclusion— Our comprehensive meta-analysis shows that cloud brokerage is still a formative ﬁeld. There is no doubt that progress has been achieved in the ﬁeld but considerable challenges remain to be addressed. This survey identiﬁes such challenges and directions for future research.},

	abstract = {Datacenters act as cloud-infrastructure to stakeholders across industry, government, and academia. To meet growing demand yet operate efﬁciently, datacenter operators employ increasingly more sophisticated scheduling systems, mechanisms, and policies. Although many scheduling techniques already exist, relatively little research has gone into the abstraction of the scheduling process itself, hampering design, tuning, and comparison of existing techniques. In this work, we propose a reference architecture for datacenter schedulers. The architecture follows ﬁve design principles: components with clearly distinct responsibilities, grouping of related components where possible, separation of mechanism from policy, scheduling as complex workﬂow, and hierarchical multi-scheduler structure. To demonstrate the validity of the reference architecture, we map to it stateof-the-art datacenter schedulers. We ﬁnd scheduler-stages are commonly underspeciﬁed in peer-reviewed publications. Through trace-based simulation and real-world experiments, we show underspeciﬁcation of scheduler-stages can lead to signiﬁcant variations in performance.},

However, traditional approaches based on manual conﬁguration of proprietary devices are cumbersome and error-prone, and they cannot fully utilize the capability of physical network infrastructure. Recently, software-deﬁned networking (SDN) has been touted as one of the most promising solutions for future Internet. SDN is characterized by its two distinguished features, including decoupling the control plane from the data plane and providing programmability for network application development. As a result, SDN is positioned to provide more efﬁcient conﬁguration, better performance, and higher ﬂexibility to accommodate innovative network designs. This paper surveys latest developments in this active research area of SDN. We ﬁrst present a generally accepted deﬁnition for SDN with the aforementioned two characteristic features and potential beneﬁts of SDN. We then dwell on its three-layer architecture, including an infrastructure layer, a control layer, and an application layer, and substantiate each layer with existing research efforts and its related research areas. We follow that with an overview of the de facto SDN implementation (i.e., OpenFlow). Finally, we conclude this survey paper with some suggested open research challenges.},

	abstract = {Cloud providers provision their various resources such as CPUs, memory, and storage in the form of virtual machine (VM) instances which are then allocated to the users. The users are charged based on a pay-as-you-go model, and their payments should be determined by considering both their incentives and the incentives of the cloud providers. Auction markets can capture such incentives, where users name their own prices for their requested VMs. We design an auction-based online mechanism for VM provisioning, allocation, and pricing in clouds that considers several types of resources. Our proposed online mechanism makes no assumptions about future demand of VMs, which is the case in real cloud settings. The proposed online mechanism is invoked as soon as a user places a request or some of the allocated resources are released and become available. The mechanism allocates VM instances to selected users for the period they are requested for, and ensures that the users will continue using their VM instances for the entire requested period. In addition, the mechanism determines the payment the users have to pay for using the allocated resources. We prove that the mechanism is incentive-compatible, that is, it gives incentives to the users to reveal their actual requests. We investigate the performance of our proposed mechanism through extensive experiments.},

Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel brokerage-based architecture in the cloud, where the cloud brokers is responsible for the service selection. We also design an efﬁcient indexing structure, called Bcloud-tree, for managing the information of a large number of cloud service providers. We then develop the service selection algorithm that recommends most suitable cloud services to the cloud consumers. We carry out extensive experimental studies on real and synthetic cloud data, and demonstrate a signiﬁcant performance improvement over previous approaches.},

At the ﬁrst stage, a job classiﬁer motivated by a Bayes classiﬁer’s design principle is utilized to classify tasks based on historical scheduling data. A certain number of virtual machines (VMs) of different types are accordingly created. This can save time of creating VMs during task scheduling. At the second stage, tasks are matched with concrete VMs dynamically. Dynamic task scheduling algorithms are accordingly proposed. Experimental results show that they can effectively improve the cloud’s scheduling performance and achieve the load balancing of cloud resources in comparison with existing methods.},

The handover mechanism serves to keep the connection between sensor nodes and a gateway with a low latency. The handover mechanism also attentively considers oscillating nodes which often occur in many streaming IoT systems. By leveraging the strategic position of smart gateways and Fog computing in a real-time streaming IoT system, sensor nodes’ loads were alleviated whereas advanced services, like push notiﬁcation and local data storage, were provided. The paper discussed and analyzed metrics for the handover mechanism based on Wi-Fi. In addition, a complete remote real-time health monitoring IoT system was implemented for experiments. The results from evaluating our mobility handover mechanism for mobility support shows that the latency of switching from one gateway to another is 10\%–50\% less than other state-of-the-art mobility support systems. The results show that the proposed handover mechanism is a very promising approach for mobility support in both Fog computing and IoT systems.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things provides a huge infrastructure where numerous devices produce, collect and process data. These data are the basis for offering analytics to support novel applications. The processing of huge volumes of data is a demanding process, thus, the power of Cloud is already utilized. However, latency, privacy and the drawbacks of this centralized approach became the motivation for the emerge of edge computing. In edge computing, data could be processed at the edge of the network; at the IoT nodes to deliver immediate results. Due to the limited resources of IoT nodes, it is not possible to have a high number of demanding tasks locally executed to support applications. In this paper, we propose a scheme for selecting the most significant tasks to be executed at the edge while the remaining are transferred into the Cloud. Our distributed scheme focuses on mobile IoT nodes and provides a decision making mechanism and an optimization module for delivering the tasks that will be executed locally. We take into consideration multiple characteristics of tasks and optimize the final decision. With our mechanism, IoT nodes can be adapted to, possibly, unknown environments evolving their decision making. We evaluate the proposed scheme through a high number of simulations and give numerical results.},

This new environment located at the edge comes with its own orchestration challenges. Among the orchestration functions that must be adapted to this new environment is scheduling.

Cloud platforms are being rapidly adopted by business owners and end-users thanks to its many beneﬁts to traditional computing models such as cost saving, scalability, unlimited storage, anytime anywhere access, better security, and high fault-tolerance capability. However, despite the fact that clouds offer huge opportunities and services to the industry, the landscape of cloud computing research is evolving for several reasons, such as emerging data-intensive applications, multicloud deployment models, and more strict non-functional requirements on cloud-based services. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive taxonomy of main cloud computing research areas, discuss state-of-the-art approaches for each area and the associated sub-areas, and highlight the challenges and future directions per research area. The survey framework, presented in this paper, provides useful insights and outlook for the cloud computing research and development, allows broader understanding of the design challenges of cloud computing, and sheds light on the future of this fast-growing utility computing paradigm.},

In this paradigm, there are many cloud service providers involved to offer different level of services and the effectiveness of the service specification, identification of services is always a challenging one. Hence, we propose a broker based cloud computing framework for enabling the cloud user to specify their service requirements in terms of numerical representation. The infrastructure type of services such as computing and storage are considered for this proposal. With respect to the user specification, the proposed broker constructs the cloud ontology to represent the available services from the service repository. With the aid of ontological representation, the proposed broker discovers the infrastructure services from the available vendor. The appropriate services are represented using semantic network which enables the user to know about the available services as per their posted requirements. Finally, the broker recommends the services with its add-on features to the cloud users. A prototype model is developed to simulate the functioning of the broker based service discovery in the cloud and the results show the performance upgradation by comparing the traditional approach.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing aims at allowing customers to utilize computational resources and software hosted by service providers. Thus, it shifts the complex and tedious resource and software management tasks typically done by customers to the service providers. Besides promising to eliminate these obstacles of resource management for consumers, Cloud computing also promises to reduce the cost of IT infrastructure. In particular, it promises to reduce the cost of IT through lower capital and operational expenses, stemming from a Cloud’s economies of scale and from allowing organizations to purchase just as much computer and storage resources as needed whenever needed. A clear specification of savings however requires a detailed specification of the costs incurred. Although there are some efforts to define cost models for Clouds, the need for a comprehensive cost model, which covers all cost factors, is undeniable. In this paper, we cover this gap by suggesting a cost model for hybrid Clouds (i.e., the combinations of a private data center (private Cloud) and the public Cloud). This model is based on a comprehensive literature research on cost factors and the idea of combining cost of data centers and cost for using Clouds. Finally, we demonstrate the workings of the suggested cost model by applying it to a specific Cloud scenario.},

As such cloud computing is an emerging promising approach for High Performance Computing (HPC) application development. Automation of resource provision offered by Cloud computing facilitates the eScience programmer usage of computing and storage resources. Currently, there are many commercial services for compute, storage, network and many others from big name companies. However, these services typically do not have performance guarantees associated with them. This results in unexpected performance degradation of user’s applications that can be somewhat random to the user. In order to overcome this, a user must be well versed in the tools and technologies that drive Cloud Computing. One of the state of the art cloud systems, is a cloud system that provides bare metal server instances on demand. Unlike traditional cloud servers, bare metal cloud servers are free from virtualization overheads, and thus promise to be more suitable for HPC applications. In this paper, we present our study on the performance and scalability of Openstack based bare metal cloud servers, using a popular HPC benchmark suite. Our experiments conducted at UTSA Open Cloud Institute’s cloud system with 200 cores demonstrate excellent scaling performance of bare metal cloud servers.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing users are faced with a wide variety of services to choose from. Consequently, a number of cloud service brokers (CSBs) have emerged to help users in their service selection process. This paper reviews the recent approaches that have been introduced and used for cloud service brokerage and discusses their challenges accordingly. We propose a set of attributes for a CSB to be considered eﬀective. Diﬀerent CSBs’ approaches are classiﬁed as either single service or multiple service models. The CSBs are then assessed, analyzed, and compared with respect to the proposed set of attributes. Based on our studies, CSBs with multiple service models that support more of the proposed eﬀective CSB attributes have wider application in cloud computing environments.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing is a recent advancement wherein IT infrastructure and applications are provided as ‘services’ to end-users under a usage-based payment model. It can leverage virtualized services even on the ﬂy based on requirements (workload patterns and QoS) varying with time. The application services hosted under Cloud computing model have complex provisioning, composition, conﬁguration, and deployment requirements. Evaluating the performance of Cloud provisioning policies, application workload models, and resources performance models in a repeatable manner under varying system and user conﬁgurations and requirements is difﬁcult to achieve. To overcome this challenge, we propose CloudSim: an extensible simulation toolkit that enables modeling and simulation of Cloud computing systems and application provisioning environments. The CloudSim toolkit supports both system and behavior modeling of Cloud system components such as data centers, virtual machines (VMs) and resource provisioning policies. It implements generic application provisioning techniques that can be extended with ease and limited effort. Currently, it supports modeling and simulation of Cloud computing environments consisting of both single and inter-networked clouds (federation of clouds). Moreover, it exposes custom interfaces for implementing policies and provisioning techniques for allocation of VMs under inter-networked Cloud computing scenarios. Several researchers from organizations, such as HP Labs in U.S.A., are using CloudSim in their investigation on Cloud resource provisioning and energy-efﬁcient management of data center resources. The usefulness of CloudSim is demonstrated by a case study involving dynamic provisioning of application services in the hybrid federated clouds environment. The result of this case study proves that the federated Cloud computing model signiﬁcantly improves the application QoS requirements under ﬂuctuating resource and service demand patterns.

	abstract = {Cloud computing is required by modern technology. Task scheduling and resource allocation are important aspects of cloud computing. This paper proposes a heuristic approach that combines the modified analytic hierarchy process (MAHP), bandwidth aware divisible scheduling (BATS) + BAR optimization, longest expected processing time preemption (LEPT), and divide-and-conquer methods to perform task scheduling and resource allocation. In this approach, each task is processed before its actual allocation to cloud resources using a MAHP process. The resources are allocated using the combined BATS + BAR optimization method, which considers the bandwidth and load of the cloud resources as constraints. In addition, the proposed system preempts resource intensive tasks using LEPT preemption. The divide-and-conquer approach improves the proposed system, as is proven experimentally through comparison with the existing BATS and improved differential evolution algorithm (IDEA) frameworks when turnaround time and response time are used as performance metrics.},

	abstract = {By introducing microgrids, energy management is required to control the power generation and consumption for residential, industrial, and commercial domains, e.g., in residential microgrids and homes. Energy management may also help us to reach zero net energy (ZNE) for the residential domain. Improvement in technology, cost, and feature size has enabled devices everywhere, to be connected and interactive, as it is called Internet of Things (IoT). The increasing complexity and data, due to the growing number of devices like sensors and actuators, require powerful computing resources, which may be provided by cloud computing. However, scalability has become the potential issue in cloud computing. In this paper, fog computing is introduced as a novel platform for energy management. The scalability, adaptability, and open source software/hardware featured in the proposed platform enable the user to implement the energy management with the customized control-as-services, while minimizing the implementation cost and time-to-market. To demonstrate the energy management-as-a-service over fog computing platform in different domains, two prototypes of home energy management (HEM) and microgrid-level energy management have been implemented and experimented.},

In order to improve the response time, the conﬁdentiality, or the energy consumption of IoT applications, part of IoT services must be operated on servers, deployed close to connected devices. This said, much remains to be done for the practical realization of this vision. What are edge servers? Where will they be deployed? These are some questions that are poorly addressed in the literature. In this paper, we propose to build an edge computing framework around new datacenter models in which computing servers are seamlessly integrated in buildings. The datacenter models we are considering have been developed around the concept of data furnace. This concept has been implemented in european cities for district heating. Our paper introduces a new processing model in which edge and distributed cloud computing are operated with the same data furnace servers. We then discuss the challenges in the utilization of this model for edge computing. Our discussion deals with urban integration, service computing frameworks and performance issues. Finally, we end with an impact analysis of our proposition on the future of cloud computing.},

However, while these distributed systems are more cost-eﬀective, their heterogeneity in terms of hardware, software, and systems administration, and the lack of accurate resource information leads to ineﬃcient scheduling. In addition, and in contrast to the workloads of tightly coupled high-performance computing systems, a large part of the workloads submitted to these distributed systems consists of large sets (bags) of sequential tasks. Therefore, a realistic performance analysis of scheduling bags-of-tasks in large-scale distributed systems is important. Towards this end, we introduce in this paper a realistic workload model for bags-of-tasks, and we explore through trace-based simulations the design space of scheduling bags-of-tasks. Finally, we identify three new scheduling policies that use only inaccurate information when scheduling, and we compare them against known classes of proposed scheduling policies.},

Hierarchical, distributed and heterogeneous nature of computational instances make application placement in Fog a challenging task. Diversified user expectations and different features of IoT devices also intensify the application placement problem. Placement of applications to compatible Fog instances based on user expectations can enhance Quality of Experience (QoE) regarding the system services. In this paper, we propose a QoE-aware application placement policy that prioritizes different application placement requests according to user expectations and calculates the capabilities of Fog instances considering their current status. In Fog computing environment, it also facilitates placement of applications to suitable Fog instances so that user QoE is maximized in respect of utility access, resource consumption and service delivery. The proposed policy is evaluated by simulating a Fog environment using iFogSim. Experimental results indicate that the policy significantly improves data processing time, network congestion, resource affordability and service quality.},

	abstract = {Recent developments in telecommunications have allowed drawing new paradigms, including the Internet of Everything, to provide services by the interconnection of different physical devices enabling the exchange of data to enrich and automate people’s daily activities; and Fog computing, which is an extension of the well-known Cloud computing, bringing tasks to the edge of the network exploiting characteristics such as lower latency, mobility support, and location awareness. Combining these paradigms opens a new set of possibilities for innovative services and applications; however, it also brings a new complex scenario that must be efficiently managed to properly fulfill the needs of the users. In this scenario, the Fog Orchestrator component is the key to coordinate the services in the middle of Cloud computing and Internet of Everything. In this paper, key challenges in the development of the Fog Orchestrator to support the Internet of Everything are identified, including how they affect the tasks that a Fog service Orchestrator should perform. Furthermore, different service Orchestrator architectures for the Fog are explored and analyzed in order to identify how the previously listed challenges are being tackled. Finally, a discussion about the open challenges, technological directions, and future of the research on this subject is presented.},

Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of workloads derives the provisioning of appropriate resources to cloud workloads. Discovery of best workload–resource pair based on application requirements of cloud users is an optimization problem. Acceptable QoS cannot be provided to the cloud users until provisioning of resources is offered as a crucial ability. QoS parameters-based resource provisioning technique is therefore required for efﬁcient provisioning of resources. This research depicts a broad methodical literature analysis of cloud resource provisioning in general and cloud resource identiﬁcation in speciﬁc. The existing research is categorized generally into various groups in the area of cloud resource provisioning. In this paper, a methodical analysis of resource provisioning in cloud computing is presented, in which resource management, resource provisioning, resource provisioning evolution, different types of resource provisioning mechanisms and their comparisons, beneﬁts and open issues are described.

However, cloud service typically come with various levels of services and performance characteristics, which makes Quality of Cloud Service (QoCS) high variance. Hence, it is difﬁcult for the users to evaluate these cloud services and select them to ﬁt their QoCS requirements. In this paper, we propose an accurate evaluation approach of QoCS in service-oriented cloud computing. We ﬁrst employ fuzzy synthetic decision to evaluate cloud service providers according to cloud users’ preferences and then adopt cloud model to computing the uncertainty of cloud services based on monitored QoCS data. Finally, we obtain the evaluation results of QoCS using fuzzy logic control. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed approach can perform an accurate evaluation of QoCS in service-oriented cloud computing.},

In this context, a renewed formulation of the VMP problem is presented, considering the optimization of four objective functions: (i) power consumption, (ii) economical revenue, (iii) resource utilization and (iv) reconﬁguration time. To solve the presented formulation, a two-phase optimization scheme is considered, composed by an online incremental VMP phase (iVMP) and an ofﬂine VMP reconﬁguration (VMPr) phase. An experimental evaluation of ﬁve algorithms taking into account 400 different scenarios was performed, considering three VMPr Triggering and two VMPr Recovering methods as well as three VMPr resolution alternatives. Experimental results indicate which algorithm outperformed the other evaluated algorithms, improving the quality of solutions in a scenario-based uncertainty model considering the following evaluation criteria: (i) average, (ii) maximum and (iii) minimum objective function costs.},

Unlike direct experimentation via an application deployment on a real-world testbed, simulation enables fully repeatable and conﬁgurable experiments for arbitrary hypothetical scenarios. Two key concerns are accuracy (so that simulation results are scientiﬁcally sound) and scalability (so that simulation experiments can be fast and memory-eﬃcient). While the scalability of a simulator is easily measured, the accuracy of many state-of-the-art simulators is largely unknown because they have not been suﬃciently validated. In this work we describe recent accuracy and scalability advances made in the context of the SimGrid simulation framework. A design goal of SimGrid is that it should be versatile, i.e., applicable across all aforementioned domains. We present quantitative results that show that SimGrid compares favorably to state-of-the-art domain-speciﬁc simulators in terms of scalability, accuracy, or the trade-oﬀ between the two. An important implication is that, contrary to popular wisdom, striving for versatility in a simulator is not an impediment but instead is conducive to improving both accuracy and scalability.},

	abstract = {Scientiﬁc workﬂow management systems face a new challenge in the era of cloud computing. The past availability of rich information regarding the state of the used infrastructures is gone. Thus, organising virtual infrastructures so that they not only support the workﬂow being executed, but also optimise for several service level objectives (e.g., maximum energy consumption limit, cost, reliability, availability) become dependent on good infrastructure modelling and prediction techniques. While simulators have been successfully used in the past to aid research on such workﬂow management systems, the currently available cloud related simulation toolkits suffer form several issues (e.g., scalability, narrow scope) that hinder their applicability. To address this need, this paper introduces techniques for unifying two existing simulation toolkits by ﬁrst analysing the problems with the current simulators, and then by illustrating the problems faced by workﬂow systems through the example of the ASKALON environment. Finally, we show how the uniﬁcation of the selected simulators improve on the the discussed problems.},

To materialize this promise, Grids need to provide full automation from the experiment design to the ﬁnal result. Often, this automation relies on the execution of workﬂows, that is, on jobs comprising many inter-related computing and data transfer tasks. While several Grid workﬂow execution tools already exist, not much details are known about their executions. Using the ASKALON Grid middleware for workﬂow execution, a performance evaluation of the executed workﬂows is done. We introduce a tool which provides online as well as ofﬂine interactive graphical visualisation of the performance of workﬂow executions. Analysis of logged workﬂow executions on the Austrian Grid with this performance tool facilitates the detection of various performance problems and of resulting improvement possibilities for the ASKALON system.},

Cloud applications have different composition, configuration, and deployment requirements. Quantifying the performance of resource allocation policies and application scheduling algorithms at finer details in Cloud computing environments for different application and service models under varying load, energy performance (power consumption, heat dissipation), and system size is a challenging problem to tackle. To simplify this process, in this paper we propose CloudSim: an extensible simulation toolkit that enables modelling and simulation of Cloud computing environments. The CloudSim toolkit supports modelling and creation of one or more virtual machines (VMs) on a simulated node of a Data Center, jobs, and their mapping to suitable VMs. It also allows simulation of multiple Data Centers to enable a study on federation and associated policies for migration of VMs for reliability and automatic scaling of applications.},

	abstract = {One measure of usefulness of a general-purpose distributed computing system is the system’s ability to provide a level of performance commensurate to the degree of multiplicity of resources present in the system. Many different approaches and metrics of performance have been proposed in an attempt to achieve this goal in existing systems. In addition, analogous problem formulations exist in other fields such as control theory, operations research, and production management. However, due to the wide variety of approaches to this problem, it is difficult to meaningfully compare different systems since there is no uniform means for qualitatively or quantitatively evaluating them. It is difficult to successfully build upon existing work or identify areas worthy of additional effort without some understanding of the relationships between past efforts. I n this paper, a taxonomy of approaches to the resource management problem is presented in an attempt to provide a common terminology and classification mechanism necessary in addressing this problem. The taxonomy, while presented and discussed in terms of distributed scheduling, is also applicable to most types of resource management. As an illustration of the usefulness of the taxonomy an annotated bibliography is given which classifies a large number of distributed scheduling approaches according to the taxonomy.},

This work focuses on comparing many employed and proposed pricing models techniques and highlights the pros and cons of each. The comparison is based on many aspects such as fairness, pricing approach, and utilization period. Such an approach provides a solid ground for designing better models in the future.

It has captured significant attention of academia, industries, and government bodies. Now, it has emerged as the backbone of modern economy by offering subscription-based services anytime, anywhere following a pay-as-you-go model. This has instigated (1) shorter establishment times for start-ups, (2) creation of scalable global enterprise applications, (3) better cost-to-value associativity for scientific and high performance computing applications, and (4) different invocation/execution models for pervasive and ubiquitous applications. The recent technological developments and paradigms such as serverless computing, software-defined networking, Internet of Things, and processing at network edge are creating new opportunities for Cloud computing. However, they are also posing several new challenges and creating the need for new approaches and research strategies, as well as the re-evaluation of the models that were developed to address issues such as scalability, elasticity, reliability, security, sustainability, and application models. The proposed manifesto addresses them by identifying the major open challenges in Cloud computing, emerging trends, and impact areas. It then offers research directions for the next decade, thus helping in the realisation of Future Generation Cloud Computing.},

This paper conducts a multidisciplinary systematic literature review drawing from CS, IS, and Business disciplines to understand the current evidence on the quantification of financial value from cloud computing investments. The study identified 53 articles, which were coded in an analytical framework across six themes (measurement type, costs, benefits, adoption type, actor and service model). Future research directions were presented for each theme. The review highlights the need for multi-disciplinary research which both explores and further develops the conceptualization of value in cloud computing research, and research which investigates how IT value manifests itself across the chain of service provision and in inter-organizational scenarios.},

  abstract = {Cloud computing has succeeded in transforming the ICT industry, making software and hardware services even more accessible to businesses and establishing an environment for rapid innovation. Since cloud computing is an innovative business model, whose deployment is accompanied by huge investments, a thorough, multilevel cost analysis of provided services is vital. Such an analysis should focus, among others, on demand forecasting for computational resources and financial assessment of cloud computing investments, estimating crucial economic parameters, such as Net Present Value (NPV), Return of Investment (ROI) and Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). Into this context, a model-driven techno-economic approach is introduced in this paper targeting the estimation of economic parameters of cloud service deployment, which is able to assist decision support procedures for cloud users, cloud providers and cloud brokers. SysML is adopted as a modeling language for describing cloud architectures as system-of-systems (SoS), emphasizing cost properties. As an example, the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for cloud infrastructure and services is explored. TCO properties are incorporated into SysML cloud models, while cloud providers are facilitated in computing TCO.},

In addition public cloud providers have also expanded the number and type of storage options and established incremental price points for storage and network transmission of outbound data from the cloud facility. This has greatly complicated the analysis to determine the most economical option for moving general purpose applications to the cloud. This paper investigates whether this economic analysis for moving general purpose applications to the public cloud can be extended to more computationally intensive HPC type computations. Using an HPC baseline hardware configuration for comparison, the total cost of operations for several HPC private and public cloud providers are analyzed. The analysis shows under what operational conditions the public cloud option may be a more cost effective alternative for HPC type applications.},

  abstract = {Public cloud providers offer a wide range of instance types with different speeds, configurations, and prices, which allows users to choose the most appropriate configurations for their applications. When executing paral- lel applications that require multiple instances to execute, such as large scientific applications, most users pick an instance type that fits their overall needs best, and then create a cluster of interconnected instances of the same type. However, the tasks of a parallel application often have different demands in terms of performance and memory usage. This difference in demands can be exploited by selecting multiple instance types that are adapted to the demands of the application. This way, the combination of public cloud heterogeneity and ap- plication heterogeneity can be exploited in order to reduce the execution cost without significant performance loss. In this paper we conduct an evaluation of three major public cloud providers: Microsoft, Amazon, and Google, comparing their suitability for heterogeneous execution. Results show that Azure is the most suitable of the three providers, with cost efficiency gains of up to 50\% compared to homogeneous execution, while maintaining the same performance.},

  abstract = {Commercial clouds bring a great opportunity to the scientific computing area. Scientific applications usually require significant resources, however not all scientists have access to sufficient high-end computing systems. Cloud computing has gained the attention of scientists as a competitive resource to run HPC applications at a potentially lower cost. But as a different infrastructure, it is unclear whether clouds are capable of running scientific applications with a reasonable performance per money spent. This work provides a comprehensive evaluation of EC2 cloud in different aspects. We first analyze the potentials of the cloud by evaluating the raw performance of different services of AWS such as compute, memory, network and I/O. Based on the findings on the raw performance, we then evaluate the performance of the scientific applications running in the cloud. Finally, we compare the performance of AWS with a private cloud, in order to find the root cause of its limitations while running scientific applications. This paper aims to assess the ability of the cloud to perform well, as well as to evaluate the cost of the cloud in terms of both raw performance and scientific applications performance. Furthermore, we evaluate other services including S3, EBS and DynamoDB among many AWS services in order to assess the abilities of those to be used by scientific applications and frameworks. We also evaluate a real scientific computing application through the Swift parallel scripting system at scale. Armed with both detailed benchmarks to gauge expected performance and a detailed monetary cost analysis, we expect this paper will be a recipe cookbook for scientists to help them decide where to deploy and run their scientific applications between public clouds, private clouds, or hybrid clouds.},

In this paper, we take a holistic viewpoint to answer the question\textemdash{}why and who should choose cloud for HPC, for what applications, and how should cloud be used for HPC? To this end, we perform comprehensive performance and cost evaluation and analysis of running a set of HPC applications on a range of platforms, varying from supercomputers to clouds. Further, we improve performance of HPC applications in cloud by optimizing HPC applications' characteristics for cloud and cloud virtualization mechanisms for HPC. Finally, we present novel heuristics for online application-aware job scheduling in multi-platform environments. Experimental results and simulations using CloudSim show that current clouds cannot substitute supercomputers but can effectively complement them. Significant improvement in average turnaround time (up to 2X) and throughput (up to 6X) can be attained using our intelligent application-aware dynamic scheduling heuristics compared to single-platform or application-agnostic scheduling.},

  abstract = {While High Performance Computing (HPC) centers continuously evolve to provide more computing power to their users, we observe a wish for the convergence between Cloud Computing (CC) and High Performance Computing (HPC) platforms, with the commercial hope to see Cloud Computing (CC) infrastructures to eventually replace in-house facilities. If we exclude the performance point of view where many previous studies highlight a non-negligible overhead induced by the virtualization layer at the heart of every Cloud middleware when running a HPC workload, the question of the real cost-effectiveness is often left aside with the intuition that, most probably, the instances offered by the Cloud providers are competitive from a cost point of view. In this article, we wanted to assert (or infirm) this intuition by analyzing what composes the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of an in-house HPC facility operated internally since 2007. This Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) model is then used to compare with the induced cost that would have been required to run the same platform (and the same workload) over a competitive Cloud IaaS offer. Our approach to address this price comparison is three-fold. First we propose a theoretical price-performance model based on the study of the actual Cloud instances proposed by one of the major Cloud IaaS actors: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). Then, based on the HPC facility TCO analysis we propose a hourly price comparison between our in-house cluster and the equivalent EC2 instances. Finally, based on the experimental benchmarking on the local cluster and on the Cloud instances we propose an update of the former theoretical price model to reflect the real system performance. The results obtained advocate in general for the acquisition of an in-house HPC facility, which balances the common intuition in favor of Cloud Computing platforms, would they be provided by the reference Cloud provider worldwide.},

Compared with the traditional grid computing that has been employed by scientific projects for decades, the emerging cloud computing technology offers scientists an alternative of acceptable computing performance and massive storage required with lower infrastructure construction cost and more elastic and flexible system extendibility. Despite these enticing benefits and growing interest of exercising science cloud, there exist uncertainties and challenges that barricade the wide adoption of cloud computing in the scientific field. The goal of this paper is to identify the key consideration factors of adopting cloud computing for science and explore the interrelationship among them. We first developed a comprehensive hierarchy of consideration factors comprising four dimensions and ten underlying factors. Subsequently, we conducted an in-depth survey and interview of 22 domain experts who were actively involved in constructing Taiwan national science clouds. The surveyed data was finally analyzed by employing Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) technique to explore the influential network relationship of these consideration factors. Our findings suggest that Cost, Networking, and Elasticity are the top three dominant factors influencing the adoption of cloud computing for science.},

	abstract = {The popularity of cloud computing and IaaS has spawned numerous cloud service providers which offer various cloud services, including IaaS, to cloud users. These services vary considerably in terms of their performance and cost and the selection of a suitable cloud service becomes a complex decisionmaking issue for a cloud service user. Furthermore, the cloud services have several attributes all of which are the criteria that have to be taken into account when making a service selection decision. In the presence of these multiple criteria, a compromise has to be made because in most real-world situations, no single service exceeds all other services in all criteria but one service may be better in terms of some of the criteria while other services may outperform it if judged on the basis of the remaining criteria. Multi-criteria decision-making is a sub-ﬁeld in operations research that deals with the techniques to solve such multi-criteria problems. There are several methods of multicriteria decision-making. In this paper, we use key multi-criteria decision-making methods for IaaS cloud service selection in a case study which contains ﬁve basic performance measurements of thirteen cloud services by a third party monitoring service. We demonstrate the use of these multi-criteria methods for cloud service selection and compare the results obtained by using each method to ﬁnd out how the choice of a particular MCDM method affects the outcome of the decision-making process for IaaS cloud service selection.},

	abstract = {Cloud Computing (CC) has become increasingly popular since it provides a wide variety of customized and reliable computational services. With the rapid growth of this technology, more and more IT services providers compete to offer high-quality and cost-effective cloud services that best fulﬁll their customers’ needs. Given the vast diversity of these offers, the choice of the most appropriate Cloud Service Provider (CSP) became a dilemma that confuses most cloud customers. Many diverged criteria have to be considered to precisely evaluate services offered by several CSPs, some of these criteria cannot be quantiﬁed easily such as usability and security. The selection of the best CSP is thus a complex MultiCriteria Decision Making (MCDM) problem that needs to be addressed efﬁciently. Previous studies of this problem employed MCDM methods that are either unfeasible when it is difﬁcult or meaningless to quantify alternatives over criteria or computationally expensive and inconsistent when relative preferences of alternatives and criteria are used instead. In this paper, we propose a novel MCDM approach that is feasible, efﬁcient and consistent using relative preferences of criteria and alternatives. The proposed approach incorporates Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and the Best Worst Method (BWM) to rank CSPs using evaluation criteria characterizing their services. The integrated approach has been tested and validated through a use-case scenario which demonstrates its effectiveness and correctness. We have also compared the proposed approach to the most commonly used MCDM approach, Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP). The results clearly show that the proposed approach outperforms AHP in terms of computational complexity and consistency; hence, it is more efﬁcient and reliable than AHP.},

Notwithstanding this contribution, the large upfront investment and technical expertise required has limited the adoption of HPC to large organizations, government bodies, and third level institutions. Recent advances in cloud computing and telecommunications have the potential to overcome the historical issues associated with HPC through increased ﬂexibility and efﬁciency, and reduced capital and operational expenditure. This study seeks to advance the literature on technology adoption and assimilation in the under-examined HPC context through a mixed methods approach. Firstly, the determinants of cloud computing adoption for HPC are examined through a survey of 121 HPC decision makers worldwide. Secondly, a modiﬁed Delphi method was conducted with 13 experts to identify and prioritize critical issues in the adoption of cloud computing for HPC. Results from the quantitative phase suggest that only organizational and human factors signiﬁcantly inﬂuence cloud computing adoption decisions for HPC. While security was not identiﬁed as a signiﬁcant inﬂuencer in adoption decisions, qualitative research ﬁndings suggest that data privacy and security issues are an immediate and long-term concern.},

Whereas elasticity, which is often referred to as the most beneﬁcial cloud-speciﬁc property, has been heavily used in the context of interactive (multi-tier) applications, elasticity-related research in the HPC domain is still in its infancy. Existing parallel computing theory as well as traditional metrics to analytically evaluate parallel systems do not comprehensively consider elasticity, i.e., the ability to control the number of processing units at runtime. To address these issues, we introduce a conceptual framework to understand elasticity in the context of parallel systems, deﬁne the term elastic parallel system, and discuss novel metrics for both elasticity control at runtime as well as the ex-post performance evaluation of elastic parallel systems. Based on the conceptual framework, we provide an in-depth analysis of existing research in the ﬁeld to describe the state-of-the-art and compile our ﬁndings into a research agenda for future research on elastic parallel systems.},

	abstract = {High Performance Computing (HPC) clouds are becoming an alternative to on-premise clusters for executing scientific applications and business analytics services. Most research efforts in HPC cloud aim to understand the cost-benefit of moving resource-intensive applications from on-premise environments to public cloud platforms. Industry trends show hybrid environments are the natural path to get the best of the on-premise and cloud resources---steady (and sensitive) workloads can run on on-premise resources and peak demand can leverage remote resources in a pay-as-you-go manner. Nevertheless, there are plenty of questions to be answered in HPC cloud, which range from how to extract the best performance of an unknown underlying platform to what services are essential to make its usage easier. Moreover, the discussion on the right pricing and contractual models to fit small and large users is relevant for the sustainability of HPC clouds. This paper brings a survey and taxonomy of efforts in HPC cloud and a vision on what we believe is ahead of us, including a set of research challenges that, once tackled, can help advance businesses and scientific discoveries. This becomes particularly relevant due to the fast increasing wave of new HPC applications coming from big data and artificial intelligence.},

This paper proposes a tool that supports the architecture assessment of cloud migration or adoption initiatives. A systematic literature review is conducted to gain a better understanding of the characteristics of a system that are important to consider when analyzing the cloud viability of a system. Considering the technical aspects of cloud adoption, this paper proposes several criteria linked to software qualities. With the criteria set established, weights are then defined according to their respective importance in the system, supporting the readiness level classification that a system has regarding cloud computing, based on multi-criteria decision analysis. The developed solution is then applied in a case study, assessing the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed tool for the cloud adoption process.},

	abstract = {Scientific workflows consist of many interdependent tasks dictated by their data dependencies. As these workflows are becoming resource-intensive in both data and computing, private clouds struggle to cope with their resource requirements. Private cloud’s limitations are claimed to be addressed by public clouds, however, the complete offloading of workflow execution to public clouds causes excessive data transfer. In this paper, we address the problem of scheduling scientific workflows on hybrid clouds aiming at cost reduction while improving execution time, with the consideration of public cloud costs, by minimizing data movements between private cloud and public cloud. To this end, we develop Hybrid Scheduling for Hybrid Clouds (HSHC) as a novel data-locality aware scheduling algorithm. HSHC adopts a hybrid approach consisting of static phase and dynamic phase. The former solves the problem of workflow scheduling, using an extended genetic algorithm, with static information of workflows and resources. The latter dynamically adapts the static schedule in response to changing execution conditions, such as locality of intermediate output data and performance degradation of tasks and resources. We evaluate HSHC with both random workflows and real-world scientific applications in execution time and cost. Experimental results compared with seven state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate HSHC significantly reduces the cost by up to 40\% and improves the execution time by up to 25\%.},

In particular, new paradigms should be designed to leverage the greater scalability and elasticity oﬀered by federated Cloud infrastructures, as well as tools should be developed to implement a more secure, resilient and performing inter-cloud ecosystem. Such solutions can enable application owners to control in a ﬁner-grained manner the security and dependability of their resources across federated Clouds, in order to satisfy the same critical requirements achieved by hosting the application on its private Cloud. This paper presents the main technical issues and challenges, which must be addressed to migrate mission-critical applications on public Clouds.},

  abstract = {With the increasing digital media content, cloud computing's importance is scaling up very fast. It provides ease of management for the growing media content. Besides this, features like ubiquitous access, service creation, service discovery and resource provisioning play a significant role. Cloud arena is going beyond this now, and the next era is of cloud federation. Services would be brought up together to the user through multiple clouds, known as cloud federation or intercloud computing. Although still in its infancy, intercloud computing is meant to provide more scalable, efficient and better managed services. Cloud broker is an important feature of intercloud computing, which plays its role in terms of resource management, service discovery, service-level agreement negotiation and match making between service provider(s) and customer(s). The already performed studies have trivially addressed brokerage in intercloud environment, and no complete resource management model is presented so far. In this study, we present a detailed service-oriented dynamic resource management model, which covers the issues of resource prediction, customer type-based resource estimation and reservation, advanced reservation, pricing, refunding and acquired quality of service-based refunding. We have implemented our system in Java/NetBeans 8.0 (Oracle Corporation) and evaluated through CloudSim 3.0.3 (The CLOUDS Lab, The University of Melbourne, Australia) toolkit, on 11 parameters. Our methodology was modelled on Google Cluster trace of 12 000 machines. The results and discussion show the validity and performance of our system.

Although outsourcing computation paradigm brings many benefits for both clients and cloud server, it causes some security challenges. In this paper, we focus on the outsourcing computation of matrix multiplication, and propose a new publicly verifiable computation scheme for batch matrix multiplication. Different from traditional matrix computation outsourcing model, the outsourcing task of our scheme is to compute M Xi for group of clients, where Xi is a private matrix chosen by different clients and M is a public matrix given by a data center beforehand. Based on the two techniques of privacypreserving matrix transformation and matrix digest, our scheme can protect the secrecy of the client's private matrix Xi and dramatically reduce the computation cost in both the key generation and the compute phases. The security analysis shows that the proposed scheme can also achieve the desired security properties under the co-CDH assumption.},

A systematic literature review is conducted to gain a better understanding of the characteristics of a system that are important to consider when analyzing the cloud viability of a system. Considering the technical aspects of cloud adoption, this paper proposes several criteria linked to software qualities. With the criteria set established, weights are then defined according to their respective importance in the system, supporting the readiness level classification that a system has regarding cloud computing, based on multi-criteria decision analysis. The developed solution is then applied in a case study, assessing the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed tool for the cloud adoption process.},

It will likely have a significant impact on the educational environment in the future. Cloud computing is an excellent alternative for educational institutions which are especially under budget shortage in order to operate their information systems effectively without spending any more capital for the computers and network devices. Universities take advantage of available cloud-based applications offered by service providers and enable their own users/students to perform business and academic tasks. In this paper, we will review what the cloud computing infrastructure will provide in the educational arena, especially in the universities where the use of computers are more intensive and what can be done to increase the benefits of common applications for students and teachers.},

  abstract = {Heterogeneous networks (HetNets) have the potential to cater for the capacity requirements of mobile broadband services at reduced cost and energy consumption levels. One key aspect in HetNets is the role of the backhaul. More specifically, it is crucial for a mobile operator to understand the impact of specific technological and architectural upgrades in the mobile backhaul network on the capital and operational expenditure (i.e., CAPEX and OPEX). This paper proposes a comprehensive methodology that can be used to analyze the total cost of ownership of a number of backhaul options based on fiber, microwave, and copper technologies. The study considers both a Greenfield and a Brownfield scenario and takes into account the mobile broadband capacity requirements for the time period between years 2015 and 2025. From the results presented in the paper it can be concluded that even though microwave and fiber will be predominately used in the future, the possible migration paths leading to such fiber- and microwave-based backhaul scenarios might be different, depending upon factors such as spectrum and license costs, time to deployment, availability of equipment, and required quality of service levels.},

Complex Cloud deployments can result in an intricate layered structure. Understanding the behaviour of these hierarchical systems and how to manage them optimally are challenging tasks that can be facilitated by pervasive monitoring. Monitoring tools and techniques have an important role to play in this area by gathering the information required to make informed decisions. A broad variety of monitoring tools are available, from general-purpose infrastructure monitoring tools that predate Cloud computing, to high-level application monitoring services that are themselves hosted in the Cloud. Surveying the capabilities of monitoring tools can identify the fitness of these tools in serving certain objectives. Monitoring tools are essential components to deal with various objectives of both Cloud providers and consumers in different Cloud operational areas. We have identified the practical capabilities that an ideal monitoring tool should possess to serve the objectives in these operational areas. Based on these identified capabilities, we present a taxonomy and analyse the monitoring tools to determine their strength and weaknesses. In conclusion, we present our reflections on the analysis, discuss challenges and identify future research trends in the area of Cloud monitoring.},

Since cloud computing is an innovative business model, whose deployment is accompanied by huge investments, a thorough, multilevel cost analysis of provided services is vital. Such an analysis should focus, among others, on demand forecasting for computational resources and financial assessment of cloud computing investments, estimating crucial economic parameters, such as Net Present Value (NPV), Return of Investment (ROI) and Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). Into this context, a model-driven techno-economic approach is introduced in this paper targeting the estimation of economic parameters of cloud service deployment, which is able to assist decision support procedures for cloud users, cloud providers and cloud brokers. SysML is adopted as a modeling language for describing cloud architectures as system-of-systems (SoS), emphasizing cost properties. As an example, the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for cloud infrastructure and services is explored. TCO properties are incorporated into SysML cloud models, while cloud providers are facilitated in computing TCO.},

The paper describes the tool model and its implementation, and presents experiments that explore tradeoffs offered by different server configurations, performance variability, MTTF, 2D vs 3D-stacked processors, and ambient temperature. These experiments reveal, for the data center configurations used in this study, several opportunities for profit and optimization in the datacenter ecosystem: (i) servers with different computing performance and power consumption merit exploration to minimize TCO and the environmental impact, (ii) performance variability is desirable if it comes with a drastic cost reduction, (iii) shorter processor MTTF is beneficial if it comes with a moderate processor cost reduction, (iv) increasing by few degrees the ambient datacenter temperature reduces the environmental impact with a minor increase in the TCO and (v) a higher cost for a 3D-stacked processor with shorter MTTF can be preferred, over a conventional 2D processor, if it offers a moderate performance increase.},

That is, there was a temporary knowledge gap between younger and older workers in most occupations. Using this variation, we estimate how this knowledge gap affected older workers' labor market outcomes using millions of observations from the CPS, and additional data from the Health and Retirement Study. Our models control for occupation and time fixed effects and in some models, we also control for full occupation-time interactions and use middle aged (age 40-49) workers as the control group. We find strong and robust negative effects of the knowledge gap on wages, and a large, temporary increase in transitions from work to non-participation.

Numerous vendors are offering services where computing, storage and application resources, can be dynamically provisioned on a pay per use basis, purely based on the user's need. However, the demands and requirements of different users vary significantly. In order to maximize the revenue, a flexible pricing approach is required, which can address these diverse requirements systematically. These systemic approaches need to estimate the potential value of such services to specific users for a specific context. The tradeoffs from potential value drivers also need to be accounted for while prioritizing the value drivers. In these lines, the current study proposes a flexible pricing approach for Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), one of the important delivery models, based on its perceived value to multiple key stakeholders. The proposed approach prioritizes and aggregates the key features of IaaS for the migration to cloud, from multiple key users' perspective by integrating fuzzy set theory and analytic hierarchy process for group decision making under consensus. Subsequently, the prioritization is mapped with a utility function to estimate the trade-offs from each value driver. The performance of the proposed approach has also been compared with that of another flexible pricing model through a case study.},

  abstract = {The cloud service model is spreading into the telecommunications industry, forcing the telecommunications providers to adjust their production models. The network service provider cloud platform, also called as Telco Cloud, utilizing a cloud based production model, is a solution to respond to the changing market forces. The cloud based production model is a new concept in the context of telecommunication services and the cost structure of the network service provider cloud platform is poorly understood. Thus, this empirical research uses a single company single case study approach to examine the network service provider cloud cost structures and constructs a cost model to network service provider cloud by using semi-structured interviews. The results indicate that the network service provider cloud improves cost efficiency compared to the traditional platform model due to server virtualization and consolidation. The contributed cost model can be used for analyzing feasibility of an application on-boarding in network service providers that are utilizing cloud platforms for the communications services.},

  abstract = {A national research Cloud is being created as part of the National eResearch Collaboration Tools and Resources (NeCTAR) project, to supply a cost-effective computational infrastructure to Australian scholars. Since it is hard to comprehensively understand the available Cloud resources through the open indicators, we decided to empirically investigate the infrastructural performance of the NeCTAR Research Cloud. In particular, our current evaluation work shows that the communication data throughput vary significantly within and between the five existing Cloud nodes. Although operated as one Cloud system, the NeCTAR Research Cloud might have employed heterogeneous network equipment and/or technologies. As the NeCTAR project is still ongoing, the one-off evaluation results could be quickly out of date, and the evaluation implementations should be frequently repeated or replicated for monitoring or consuming the Cloud services. Thus, unlike the existing evaluation studies that mainly focused on the evaluation results or tools, we emphasize the complete procedure and backend logic of evaluation implementations. Practically, as demonstrated in this paper, the procedure and logic can be recorded into Cloud Evaluation Experiment Methodology-based evaluation templates to facilitate repeatable and comparable Cloud services evaluation.},

  abstract = {High performance computing (HPC) is widely recognized as a key enabling technology for advancing scientific progress, industrial competitiveness, national and regional security, and the quality of human life. Notwithstanding this contribution, the large upfront investment and technical expertise required has limited the adoption of HPC to large organizations, government bodies, and third level institutions. Recent advances in cloud computing and telecommunications have the potential to overcome the historical issues associated with HPC through increased flexibility and efficiency, and reduced capital and operational expenditure. This study seeks to advance the literature on technology adoption and assimilation in the under-examined HPC context through a mixed methods approach. Firstly, the determinants of cloud computing adoption for HPC are examined through a survey of 121 HPC decision makers worldwide. Secondly, a modified Delphi method was conducted with 13 experts to identify and prioritize critical issues in the adoption of cloud computing for HPC. Results from the quantitative phase suggest that only organizational and human factors significantly influence cloud computing adoption decisions for HPC. While security was not identified as a significant influencer in adoption decisions, qualitative research findings suggest that data privacy and security issues are an immediate and long-term concern.},

On the other hand, the adoption of cloud computing in enterprise environments is non-trivial. Understanding the organizational benefits and drawbacks is far from straightforward. The adoption of cloud computing results in a considerable amount of organizational change that will affect employees. The aim of this contribution is to conduct and describe the evaluation model of cloud computing that would be applicable in business practice for evaluating the effectiveness of such investments. The target users of this model are primarily people in companies with decision-making power in the investment field. The appropriate starting point based on the multi-criteria evaluation was the cost\textendash benefit analysis (CBA) approach for cloud computing (CC). A multi-method approach (systematic literature review, analysis of real cloud computing services, expert interview, case study) was applied in order to develop and evaluate the formal model.

Following this paradigm, software services can be built on compositions of cloud infrastructure services that offer fine-granular payper-use pricing models. While this development and deployment approach simplifies service development and management, it remains an open challenge to make use of fine-granular pricing models for improving cost transparency and reducing cost of service operations. As a solution, we present Costradamus, a cost-tracing system that implements a generic cost model and three different tracing approaches. With Costradamus, we can derive cost and performance information per API operation. We evaluate our approach and system in a smart grid context and discuss unexpected performance and deployment cost tradeoffs.},

This is mainly due to the high cost involved in providing and maintaining the needed hardware and software. A technology such as cloud computing that delivers on demand provisioning of IT resources on a pay per use basis can be used to address this problem. Cloud computing promises better delivery of IT services as well as availability whenever and wherever needed at reduced costs with users paying only as much as they consume through the services of cloud service providers. The cloud technology reduces complexity while increasing speed and quality of IT services provided; however, despite these benefits the challenges that come with its adoption have left many sectors especially the higher education skeptical in committing to this technology. This article identifies the reasons for the slow rate of adoption of cloud computing at university level, discusses the challenges faced and proposes a cloud computing adoption model that contains strategic guidelines to overcome the major challenges identified and a roadmap for the successful adoption of cloud computing by universities. The model was tested in one of the universities and found to be both useful and appropriate for adopting cloud computing at university level.},

  abstract = {With the widespread adoption of cloud computing, the ability to record and account for the usage of cloud resources in a credible and verifiable way has become critical for cloud service providers and users alike. The success of such a billing system depends on several factors: the billing transactions must have integrity and nonrepudiation capabilities; the billing transactions must be nonobstructive and have a minimal computation cost; and the service level agreement (SLA) monitoring should be provided in a trusted manner. Existing billing systems are limited in terms of security capabilities or computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a secure and nonobstructive billing system called THEMIS as a remedy for these limitations. The system uses a novel concept of a cloud notary authority for the supervision of billing. The cloud notary authority generates mutually verifiable binding information that can be used to resolve future disputes between a user and a cloud service provider in a computationally efficient way. Furthermore, to provide a forgery-resistive SLA monitoring mechanism, we devised a SLA monitoring module enhanced with a trusted platform module (TPM), called S-Mon. The performance evaluation confirms that the overall latency of THEMIS billing transactions (avg. 4.89 ms) is much shorter than the latency of public key infrastructure (PKI)-based billing transactions (avg. 82.51 ms), though THEMIS guarantees identical security features as a PKI. This work has been undertaken on a real cloud computing service called iCubeCloud.},

  abstract = {Resource optimization is a key concern for Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). Cloud Computing, as the recent generation in computing technology of the fourth industrial revolution, has emerged as the main standard of service and resource delivery. As cloud computing has grown into a mature technology and is being rapidly adopted in many HEIs across the world, retaining customers of this innovative technology has become a challenge to the cloud service providers. Current research trends on cloud computing have sought to study the acceptance or adoption of technology; however, little research has been devoted to the continuance use in an organizational setting. To address this gap, this study aims to investigate the antecedents of cloud computing continuance use in HEIs. Hence, drawing on the prior literature in organizational-level continuance, this research established a conceptual model that extends and contextualizes the IS continuance model through the lens of the TOE framework (i.e., technological, organizational, and environmental influences). The results of a pilot study, conducted through a survey with information and communications technology (ICT) decision makers, and based on the proposed conceptual model, indicate that the instrument is both reliable and valid, and so point the way towards further research.

These services vary considerably in terms of their performance and cost and the selection of a suitable cloud service becomes a complex decisionmaking issue for a cloud service user. Furthermore, the cloud services have several attributes all of which are the criteria that have to be taken into account when making a service selection decision. In the presence of these multiple criteria, a compromise has to be made because in most real-world situations, no single service exceeds all other services in all criteria but one service may be better in terms of some of the criteria while other services may outperform it if judged on the basis of the remaining criteria. Multi-criteria decision-making is a sub-field in operations research that deals with the techniques to solve such multi-criteria problems. There are several methods of multicriteria decision-making. In this paper, we use key multi-criteria decision-making methods for IaaS cloud service selection in a case study which contains five basic performance measurements of thirteen cloud services by a third party monitoring service. We demonstrate the use of these multi-criteria methods for cloud service selection and compare the results obtained by using each method to find out how the choice of a particular MCDM method affects the outcome of the decision-making process for IaaS cloud service selection.},

  abstract = {Cloud computing offers users the potential to reduce operating and capital expenses by leveraging the amortization benefits offered by large, managed infrastructures. However, the black-box and dynamic nature of the cloud infrastructure makes it difficult for them to reason about the expenses that their applications incur. At the same time, the profitability of cloud providers depends on their ability to multiplex several customer applications to maintain high utilization levels. However, this multiplexing may cause providers to incorrectly attribute resource consumption to customers or implicitly bear additional costs thereby reducing their cost-effectiveness. Our position in this paper is that for cloud computing as a paradigm to be sustainable in the long term, we need a systematic approach for verifiable resource accounting. Verifiability here means that cloud customers can be assured that (a) their applications indeed physically consumed the resources they were charged for and (b) that this consumption was justified based on an agreed policy. As a first step toward this vision, in this paper we articulate the challenges and opportunities for realizing such a framework.},

However, to embrace this emerging technology, the challenges and uncertainties about the expected economic, technical and operational feasibility, and related security, privacy and regulatory concerns, successful transition from planning to design and implementation, as well as its overall impact on the individual organisation, needs to be estimated or identified. Notwithstanding, such studies have been undertaken across different sectors other than the Indian school education system to tailor out unique cloud computing solutions as per the business needs of the individual organisations.

We present NodeKernel, a novel distributed storage architecture that offers a convenient new point in the design space by fusing file system and key-value semantics in a common storage kernel while leveraging modern networking and storage hardware to achieve high performance and cost-efficiency. NodeKernel provides hierarchical naming, high scalability, and close to bare-metal performance for a wide range of data sizes and access patterns that are characteristic of temporary data. We show that storing temporary data in Crail, our concrete implementation of the NodeKernel architecture which uses RDMA networking with tiered DRAM/NVMe-Flash storage, improves NoSQL workload performance by up to 4.8\texttimes{} and Spark application performance by up to 3.4\texttimes. Furthermore, by storing data across NVMe Flash and DRAM storage tiers, Crail reduces storage cost by up to 8\texttimes{} compared to DRAM-only storage systems.},

However, their inherent complexity makes them notoriously difficult to implement, meaning projects often either end in complete failure, or arrive late and overshoot budgetary costs. A clear understanding of the factors by which implantation success is measured will reduce the likelihood of these negative outcomes. This study therefore has two objectives: first to empirically validate an established conceptual model for IS success (developed by DeLone and McLean) in a BRMS context; specifically, we applied structural equation modelling techniques to validate the model using data obtained from key informants from several telecom service providers. We then prioritize our technical findings from the study, with a view to more targeted use of billing and revenue resources and equally important, consider the potential role of BRMS in driving pricing policy and dynamic product offerings. The novelty of our work lies in the adaptation of an existing model for predicting and measuring IS success at organizational level and the ensuing benefits accruing to companies beyond mere use of BRMS as a tool for managing accounts receivable.},

  abstract = {Cloud computing service providers' offer their customers' services maximizing their revenues, whereas customers wish to minimize their costs. In this paper we shall concentrate on consumers' point of view. Cloud computing services are composed of services organized according to a hierarchy of software application services, beneath them platform services which also use infrastructure services. Providers currently offer software services as bundles consisting of services which include the software, platform and infrastructure services. Providers also offer platform services bundled with infrastructure services. Bundling services prevent customers from splitting their service purchases between a provider of software and a different provider of the underlying platform or infrastructure. This bundling policy is likely to change in the long run since it contradicts economic competition theory, causing an unfair pricing model and locking-in consumers to specific service providers. In this paper we assume the existence of a free competitive market, in which consumers are free to switch their services among providers. We assume that free market competition will enforce vendors to adopt open standards, improve the quality of their services and suggest a large variety of cloud services in all layers. Our model is aimed at the potential customer who wishes to find the optimal combination of service providers which minimizes his costs. We propose three possible strategies for implementation of the model in organizations. We formulate the mathematical model and illustrate its advantages compared to existing pricing practices used by cloud computing consumers.},

Despite these enticing benefits and growing interest of exercising science cloud, there exist uncertainties and challenges that barricade the wide adoption of cloud computing in the scientific field. The goal of this paper is to identify the key consideration factors of adopting cloud computing for science and explore the interrelationship among them. We first developed a comprehensive hierarchy of consideration factors comprising four dimensions and ten underlying factors. Subsequently, we conducted an in-depth survey and interview of 22 domain experts who were actively involved in constructing Taiwan national science clouds. The surveyed data was finally analyzed by employing Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) technique to explore the influential network relationship of these consideration factors. Our findings suggest that Cost, Networking, and Elasticity are the top three dominant factors influencing the adoption of cloud computing for science.},

Reservoir models are commonly used to obtain field production forecast depending on the development plan. Generally, a specialized external high-performance computational environment is used to accomplish the aforementioned multivariate calculations, while personal workstations stay idle most of the time. We propose an alternative way of organizing HPC environment using available computational resources. The method is based on integration of several personal workstations into a so-called grid cluster using local network, which allows managing the whole system from any connected node. Each computational node is provided with a flexible timetable to ensure that distributed calculations do not interfere with daily work. The solution does not require additional capital investments and is easy to implement in the office. Although initially designed for hydrodynamic simulations, the system can be used for any time-consuming multivariate task.},

  abstract = {Cloud Computing (CC) has become increasingly popular since it provides a wide variety of customized and reliable computational services. With the rapid growth of this technology, more and more IT services providers compete to offer high-quality and cost-effective cloud services that best fulfill their customers' needs. Given the vast diversity of these offers, the choice of the most appropriate Cloud Service Provider (CSP) became a dilemma that confuses most cloud customers. Many diverged criteria have to be considered to precisely evaluate services offered by several CSPs, some of these criteria cannot be quantified easily such as usability and security. The selection of the best CSP is thus a complex MultiCriteria Decision Making (MCDM) problem that needs to be addressed efficiently. Previous studies of this problem employed MCDM methods that are either unfeasible when it is difficult or meaningless to quantify alternatives over criteria or computationally expensive and inconsistent when relative preferences of alternatives and criteria are used instead. In this paper, we propose a novel MCDM approach that is feasible, efficient and consistent using relative preferences of criteria and alternatives. The proposed approach incorporates Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and the Best Worst Method (BWM) to rank CSPs using evaluation criteria characterizing their services. The integrated approach has been tested and validated through a use-case scenario which demonstrates its effectiveness and correctness. We have also compared the proposed approach to the most commonly used MCDM approach, Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP). The results clearly show that the proposed approach outperforms AHP in terms of computational complexity and consistency; hence, it is more efficient and reliable than AHP.},

Large-scale systems of linear matrix equations (LME) are commonly deployed in scientific and engineering fields, which is a computationally complex task. Thus, it is necessary to design a protocol for practically outsourcing large-scale systems of LME to a malicious cloud. For this purpose, we propose a protocol called OutLME in this paper. In OutLME, we adopt a special permutation technique for the client to transform the original linear matrix equation into a randomized one and decrypt the result returned from cloud into the right one of original problem. As to robust cheating resistance, we propose an effective verification algorithm by utilizing the algebraic property of matrix-vector operations. In addition, both the chosen permutation technique and result verification mechanism incur close-to-zero additional cost on both the cloud and the client, so our proposed protocol is efficient. In the end, the theoretical analysis and the experimental evaluation are provided to demonstrate the validity of OutLME.},

To make users can run different application frameworks on the same datacenter, Cao et al. [5] proposed a new service model named ClaaS (Cluster as a Service) and developed a lightweight prototype system named Docklet which is based on LXC (Linux Container). Docklet faces a problem of resources waste and abuse due to our free policy. This paper introduces the monitoring and billing modules of Docklet in order to solve this problem. Monitoring module provides users and administrators with a clear, real-time and detailed monitoring interface to understand the statues of running applications and the usage of physical resources. Billing module uses these data to remind users to release unnecessary resources. An experiment and observations show that our proposed monitoring method is effective and lightweight and our proposed billing model increases the utilization of physical resources of a mini-datacenter.},

  abstract = {Hybrid cloud bursting (i.e., leasing temporary off-premise cloud resources to boost the overall capacity during peak utilization) can be a cost-effective way to deal with the increasing complexity of big data analytics, especially for iterative applications. However, the low throughput, high latency network link between the on-premise and offpremise resources (``weak link'') makes it difficult to maintain scalability. While there are several data locality techniques dedicated for big data bursting on hybrid clouds, their effectiveness is difficult to estimate in advance. On the other hand, such estimations are critical for users, because they aid in the decision of whether the extra pay-as-you-go cost incurred by using the off-premise resources justifies the runtime speed-up. To this end, the current paper contributes with a performance model and methodology to estimate the runtime of iterative MapReduce applications in a hybrid cloud bursting scenario. A key idea of the proposal is to focus on the overhead incurred by the weak link at fine granularity, both for the map and reduce phases. This enables high estimation accuracy, as demonstrated by extensive experiments at scale using a mix of real-life iterative MapReduce applications from standard big data benchmarking suites that cover a broad spectrum of data patterns. Not only are the produced estimations accurate in absolute terms compared with the actual experimental results, but they are also up to an order of magnitude more accurate than applying state-of-art estimation approaches originally designed for single-site MapReduce deployments.},

The search for the efficiency and optimisation of resources is one of the current key aspects for large Cloud Service Providers and is becoming more and more challenging, since new computing paradigms such as Internet of Things, Cyber-Physical Systems and Edge Computing are spreading. One of the key aspects to achieve efficiency in data centres consists of the discovery and proper analysis of the data-centre behaviour. In this paper, we present a model to automatically retrieve execution workflows of existing data-centre logs by employing process mining techniques. The discovered processes are characterised and analysed according to the understandability and complexity in terms of execution efficiency of data-centre jobs. We finally validate and demonstrate the usability of the proposal by applying the model in a real scenario, that is, the Google Cluster traces.},

While many organizations outsource the entire ICT solution to public clouds like Amazon Web Services Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), others consider occasional workload offloading (cloud bursting) due to various reasons including governance and security. In this paper, we present Cloud Bursting Scheduler (CBS), a new cloud bursting algorithm. CBS explicitly takes into account cost factors of private in-house system (or private cloud) and public cloud. In particular, CBS attempts to optimize the cost to performance ratio by offloading jobs to public cloud explicitly taking into account time-varying electricity rates with private clouds and the timeinvariant rental rate of many public clouds. Based on simulation results obtained using real workload traces, CBS saves costs of running workloads by 55\% and 12\% compared with costs of cloud sourcing and private cloud, respectively. It also improves resource utilization (to 89\%) by judiciously (de)activating inhouse resources and dynamically provisioning cloud resources.},

  abstract = {Recently, hybrid cloud computing paradigm has be widely advocated as a promising solution for Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) providers to effectively handle the dynamic user requests. With such a paradigm, the SaaS providers can extend their local services into the public clouds seamlessly so that the dynamic user request workload to a SaaS can be elegantly processed with both the local servers and the rented computing capacity in the public cloud. However, although it is suggested that a hybrid cloud may save cost compared with building a powerful private cloud, considerable renting cost and communication cost are still introduced in such a paradigm. How to optimize such operational cost becomes one major concern for the SaaS providers to adopt the hybrid cloud computing paradigm. However, this critical problem remains unanswered in the current state of the art. In this paper, we focus on optimizing the operational cost for the hybrid cloud paradigm by theoretically analyzing the problem with a Lyapunov optimization framework. This allows us to design an online dynamic provision algorithm. In this way, our approach can address the real-world challenges where no a priori information of public cloud renting prices is available and the future probability distribution of user requests is unknown. We then conduct extensive experimental study based on a set of real-world data, and the results confirm that our algorithm can work effectively in reducing the operational cost.},

In this work, a cost-aware job scheduling approach based on queueing theory in hybrid clouds is proposed. The job scheduling problem in the private cloud is modeled as a queueing model. A genetic algorithm is applied to achieve optimal queues for jobs to improve the utilization rate of the private cloud. Then, the task execution time is predicted by back propagation neural network. The max\textendash min strategy is applied to schedule tasks according to the prediction results in hybrid clouds. Experiments show that our cost-aware job scheduling algorithm can reduce the average job waiting time and average job response time in the private cloud. In additional, our proposed job scheduling algorithm can improve the system throughput of the private cloud. It also can reduce the average task waiting time, average task response time and total costs in hybrid clouds.},

Finding the optimal point where users' multiple job requests can be accomplished timely with minimum electricity and hardware cost is one of the key factors for system designers and managers to optimize the system configurations. Understanding the characteristics of the distribution of user task is an essential step for this purpose. At large-scale Cloud Computing data centers, a precise workload prediction will significantly help designers and operators to schedule hardware/software resources and power supplies in a more efficient manner, and make appropriate decisions to upgrade the Cloud system when the workload grows. While a lot of study has been conducted for hypervisorbased Cloud, container-based virtualization is becoming popular because of the low overhead and high efficiency in utilizing computing resources. In this paper, we have studied a set of real-world container data center traces from part of Google's cluster. We investigated the distribution of job duration, waiting time and machine utilization and the number of jobs submitted in a fix time period. Based on the quantitative study, an Ensemble Workload Prediction (EnWoP) method and a novel prediction evaluation parameter called Cloud Workload Correction Rate (CRate) have been proposed. The experimental results have verified that the EnWoP method achieved high prediction accuracy and the C-Rate evaluates the prediction methods more objective.},

This paper describes the design, development and evolution of the Pegasus Workflow Management System, which maps abstract workflow descriptions onto distributed computing infrastructures. Pegasus has been used for more than twelve years by scientists in a wide variety of domains, including astronomy, seismology, bioinformatics, physics and others. This paper provides an integrated view of the Pegasus system, showing its capabilities that have been developed over time in response to application needs and to the evolution of the scientific computing platforms. The paper describes how Pegasus achieves reliable, scalable workflow execution across a wide variety of computing infrastructures.},
